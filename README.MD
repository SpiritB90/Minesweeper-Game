#  üí£ MINESWEEPER  üî¢

#### Minesweeper is a vintage puzzle game originally created in 1989 and published by Microsoft Corporation.  It's a logic based game that allows the user to reveal cells on the grid that hides numbers and bombs/mines that are randomized on the board.  

## GamePlay

#### The user is presented a grid of cells/squares that hides either a number, bomb or an empty cell.  If a  number is revealed (1-8), that number indicates how many bombs are present in the adjacent 8 squares.  The user is then responsible to find the relationship between revealed numbers and possible bombs they may share in order to win the game.  The user has the option to 'flag' a cell they believe hides a bomb in order to help them develop a potential winning strategy.  However, if a ell is revealed that hides a bomb, the player loses and the game ends.
